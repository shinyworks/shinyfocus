The goal of shinyfocus is to make it easy to trigger server events in {shiny} apps based on elements of the app gaining or losing focus in the browser.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinyfocus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r4ds/shinyfocus")
```

## Examples

I've envisioned two primary use cases (although I hope and assume that there are many others):

- Showing help related to an input.
- Validating an input when the user is "done" with an input.

The app demonstrated here does both.

``` r
library(shinyfocus)

ui <- shiny::fluidPage(
  shinyfocus_js_dependency(),
  shiny::column(
    2,
    shiny::textInput("name", "Name:"),
    shiny::textInput("title", "Title:")
  ),
  shiny::column(
    2,
    shiny::textOutput("explanation")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe_focus(
    "name",
    output$explanation <- shiny::renderText({
      "Enter the name you want me to call you. It will be converted to Title Case."
    })
  )
  
  observe_focus(
    "title",
    output$explanation <- shiny::renderText({
      "Describe your role in 10 characters or fewer."
    })
  )
  
  observe_blur(
    "name",
    shiny::updateTextInput(
      inputId = "name",
      value = stringr::str_to_title(shiny::isolate(input$name))
    )
  )
  
  observe_blur(
    "title",
    {
      if (nchar(input$title) > 10) {
        shiny::updateTextInput(
          inputId = "title",
          value = paste(
            "Typer of",
            nchar(input$title),
            "Characters"
          )
        )
      }
    }
  )
  
}

shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Note: I feel like the "explanation" output could be cleaner.
I'd like to find a better way to implement the "explanatin" output, having it switch based on which input is selected (rather than the roundabout double observer).
I hope to update that soon!

## Related Work

-   {[shinyjs](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/)} has a function, `onevent()`, that can be used for similar functionality.
However, that implementation is different than what we do here.
